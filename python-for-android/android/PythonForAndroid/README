# Python Interpreter For Android

In order to build this project first you need to gradle build other projects,
see settings.gradle:

    Utils
    Common
    InterpreterForAndroid


# setup

1. edit local.properties to specify Android SDK.

    `sdk.dir=/home/shinji/install/android-sdk`

2. You also need to build ../python-build by running

    `NDK_PATH=/where/to/android-ndk make build` in that folder.

3. And then running python2.sh once it ended the build process.
